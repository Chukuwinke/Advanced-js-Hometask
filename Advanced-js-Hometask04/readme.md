## The task is

Create a container class that allows you to sort and swap cards.

#### Technical requirements:
- Create a class that will allow you to simulate the behavior of the column on the service [Trello](https://trello.com/)
- The class should display the column of the fixed width on the screen.
- The column should show the content in the form of cards. 
- At the first rendering of the column it will be empty.
- At the very bottom of the column should be the button "Add card". After clicking on this button at the bottom of the column before the button should appear a new empty card, you can add some text to it.
- Existing cards can be dragged up and down by changing their order in the column.
- In the upper part of the column there should be a button to sort the cards in the column alphabetically. After sorting the cards, you can freely drag and drop them.
- Use the HTML5 Drag&Drop functionality to implement card dragging.
- Example of final result: [Example](./trello_example.png)
- The application should be able to create any number of columns.
